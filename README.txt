This application allows for the entry, modification, deletion, and display 
of a note containing a subject, date, and content.
It also implements a simple action bar to display the top 100 words in the 
contents field, and a word cloud of the most common words in the note's contents fields.

The application requires Android 3.0 (API level 11) or above.
