The assignment's apk file is as1.
In the launcher, the app is called mnaylor Notes.

This application allows for the entry, modification, deletion, and
display of notes containing a subject, date, and content.

It also implements a simple action bar that contains buttons to open
the top 100 words in the contents field, and a word cloud of the most
common words in the note's contents fields.

The application requires Android 3.0 (API level 11) or above due to
the use of an action bar menu.
